Usage
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
Tips and Notes
Tip: If the <a> tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.
Tip: A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.
Tip: Use CSS to style links: CSS Links and CSS Buttons.
